example_sentences_prompt = r'''Generate two example sentences for each term and definition below. As a British lexicographer, craft sentences that are educational and accessible to English learners, incorporating subtle British cultural references where relevant. Ensure sentences vary in structure and context, and use simple language to aid understanding. Format your response as a JSON block.

Example input:
```
{
    "positive": ["If you are positive about something, you are completely sure about it.", "A positive number is greater than zero."],
    "remote": ["Remote areas are far away from cities and towns."]
}
```

Example response:
```json
{
    "positive": [{
        "Definition": "If you are positive about something, you are completely sure about it.",
        "Example": ["After the test, I was positive that I had passed.", "I am positive that I locked the door before I left the house."]
    }, {
        "Definition": "A positive number is greater than zero.",
        "Example": "The number 5 is positive."
    }],
    "remote": [{
        "Definition": "Remote areas are far away from cities and towns.",
        "Example": ["There are many remote villages in the mountains that are difficult to reach.", "The house is so remote that you can't even see the neighbours."]
    }]
}
```

example_sentences_second_prompt = r'''Write the json code block for the following input:
'''

dialogue_exercise_prompt = r'''As a British lexicographer, your task is to generate brief example dialogues containing only two exchanges between two characters for the given terms. You will be provided with a JSON file containing a list of terms together with their definitions. For each term, write the dialogue in British English. In the second exchange, subtly incorporate the term or a variation thereof. The second exchange should be concise, ideally one or two sentences long. Following the dialogue, provide a paraphrase of the second exchange that closely mirrors the original without using the term. Finally, insert a keyword from the term in the field "Keyword". For example, given the JSON file:
```json
{"one's bark is wors than his bite": "If you say that someone's bark is worse than their bite, you mean that they seem much more unpleasant or hostile than they really are."}
```
your response should be
```json
{
"one's bark is worse than his bite":{
  "A": "I'm really nervous about presenting to Mr. Thompson tomorrow. I've heard he's quite harsh.",
  "B": "Don't worry, his bark is worse than his bite. He's actually quite supportive once you get talking.",
  "Paraphrase": "Don't worry, he might seem intimidating at first, but he's actually quite supportive once you start discussing things.",
  "Keyword": "bark"
}
}
```
'''

phrase_def_prompt = r'''You are a renowned British lexicographer. Given an incomplete JSON files, you are asked to complete the file by using a professional tone and simple British English vocabulary to define the terms in concise full sentences. You should choose one of the following two structures to write definitions: 
- Structure 1: Write an "is" statement directly stating what the noun is or represents. For example, for the headword "mint" you write "Mint is a herb with fresh-tasting leaves" as its definition, where the sentence directly defines what a "mint" is and its primary characteristic.
- Structure 2: Write a sentence beginning with "If" that sets the context for the word's usage. For example, for the term "make a mint" write the definition "If you say that someone makes a mint, you mean that they make a very large amount of money", where "If you say that someone makes a mint" provides the context in which "make a mint" is used, and "you mean that they make a very large amount of money" shows how "make a mint" is used in a practical sentence. 
Following the definition, craft an example sentence for the term using British English. Your sentences should be straightforward and clear, helping learners grasp the nuances of each meaning within everyday contexts. Include subtly simple cultural or historical references to British customs and etiquette where relevant. 
Format your response in a JSON code block
```json
{
    "term": {"Definition": "Definition of the term", "Example": "Example sentence"}
}
```
'''

cloze_prompt = r'''For each of the given passages, you should create a cloze test with 3 questions in the form of a JSON code block. Do the following:
1. Select three phrases from each passage and place them in the 'Phrase' field. 
2. For each collocation, place the keyword in the 'Word' field. 
3. Find three words that can replace the keyword but will change the meaning of the phrase substantially. Place these words in the 'Incorrect options' field. Ensure these words are written in British English, and don't have similar connotations (commendatory or derogatory) to each other.
Example input:
["The ancient castle stood proudly atop the hill. Its towering walls were adorned with intricate carvings that told stories of centuries past. The castle's grandeur attracted tourists from all over the world."]

Example output:
```json
{
  "The ancient castle stood proudly atop the hill. Its towering walls were adorned with intricate carvings that told stories of centuries past. The castle's grandeur attracted tourists from all over the world.": [
    {
      "Word": "ancient", "Phrase": "ancient castle", "Incorrect options": ["shabby", "artificial", "mythical"]
    },
    {
      "Word": "adorned", "Phrase": "were adorned with", "Incorrect options": ["satisfied", "supported", "bored"]
    },
    {
      "Word": "attracted", "Phrase": "attracted tourists", "Incorrect options": ["saved", "disappointed", "ignored"]
    }
  ]
}
```

equivalence_prompt = r'''You are an renowned British lexicographer. Given a list of terms together with their definitions, do the following:
1. Write an example sentence containing the term in British English. 
2. Write a word or a phrase that can replace the term in the sentence. The word or phrase is called "Good alternative"
3. Write three words or phrases without the term that can replace the term in the sentence, but will change the meaning of the sentence substantially. These words or phrases are called "Bad alternatives". Make sure the bad alternatives don't have similar (commendatory or derogatory) connotation to each other.
Example input:
```json
{
  "remind": ["If someone reminds you of a fact or event that you already know about, they say something which makes you think about it."]
}
```
Example response:
```json
{
  "remind":[
    {
      "Definition": "If someone reminds you of a fact or event that you already know about, they say something which makes you think about it.",
      "Sentence": "So she simply welcomed him and reminded him of the last time they had met.",
      "Term in the sentence": "reminded him of",
      "Good alternative": "recalled",
      "Bad alternatives": ["mentioned", "celebrated", "forgot"]
    }
